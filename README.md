# PalindromeDatabase
Flask based application to evaluate a string input from user to see if it's a palindrome, then returns a list of palindromes 

Installation instrustions:

Clone the repository:
    git clone "repository_url"

Change directory into the cloned repository and project directory:
    cd PalindromeDatabase/PalDB

Run the python code:
    python Pal.py
<<<<<<< HEAD

=======
 
>>>>>>> master
 
I've also created the unittests which require the app to be installed which can be done as follows:
 
Change into directory of the git clone:
    cd PalindromeDatabase
    
Then use pip to install it locally:
    pip install -e .
    
To then run you need to export the flask app, so flask knows what to run
    export FLASK_APP=PalDB
    export FLASK_DEBUG=true
    flask run
    

Thank you for considering my application.
